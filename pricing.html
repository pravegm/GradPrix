            <p>We offer flexible payment options including full upfront payment, or a split payment plan (50% upfront, 50% before interview prep begins). Payment can be made via bank transfer, credit card, or PayPal. Contact us to discuss what works best for you.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No problem! You can add additional schools at any time. We'll simply adjust your package accordingly. The per-school rate becomes more favorable as you add more schools, so you'll benefit from our volume pricing.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Ideally, we recommend starting 4-6 months before your target application deadline for comprehensive support. However, we've successfully worked with candidates on tighter timelines. During our initial consultation, we'll assess your situation and create a realistic plan.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While we don't offer outcome-based refunds (as admissions involve many factors beyond our control), we're deeply committed to your success. Our track record speaks for itself, and we provide support until you receive final decisions, including waitlist strategies.</p>
