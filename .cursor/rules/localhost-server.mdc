# Starting Localhost Server

Node.js is installed at `C:\Program Files\nodejs` but is NOT in the system PATH.

To start a local development server, use this command:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "C:\Program Files\nodejs;" + $env:PATH; npx serve
```

This will:
1. Temporarily add Node.js to the PATH
2. Start the serve package on port 3000

The site will be available at **http://localhost:3000**
