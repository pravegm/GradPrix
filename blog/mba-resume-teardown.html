          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "One page. This applies to nearly all MBA applicants, regardless of experience level. Admissions committees review thousands of resumes and may spend only 30 to 60 seconds on yours. A concise, focused one-page resume demonstrates your ability to prioritise and communicate efficiently. The only rare exception is if a school explicitly allows or requires a longer format, which is uncommon."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "An MBA resume is a marketing document for admissions committees, not a job application. Job resumes focus on matching specific job descriptions with relevant skills and duties. MBA resumes should communicate your leadership, impact, growth trajectory, and what you would contribute to the classroom. Admissions committees care about your potential as a leader and classmate, not whether you can perform a specific role. This means emphasising quantified achievements, leadership moments, and transferable skills over technical responsibilities."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Include your GPA if it is above 3.5 on a 4.0 scale (or the equivalent in your grading system). If your GPA is below this threshold, leave it off your resume. The admissions committee will see your GPA on your transcript, and omitting a lower GPA from your resume avoids drawing unnecessary attention to it. If your GPA is low but you have strong academic indicators elsewhere (such as a high GMAT or GRE score, honours, or relevant coursework), you can highlight those instead."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Generally no. Your test scores are submitted separately as part of the application. Including them on the resume is unnecessary and takes up valuable space. The exception would be if the school specifically asks for the score on the resume, or if your score is significantly above the school's average and you want to feature it as a strength. In most cases, leave it off."

          "text": "For each role, include your company name, job title, location, and dates. Then list three to five bullet points per role, starting each with an action verb (led, developed, managed, launched). Each bullet should describe a specific accomplishment with quantified results wherever possible: revenue generated, costs saved, team size managed, percentage improvements, or number of clients served. Show promotions by listing them as separate entries. Focus on achievements that demonstrate leadership, initiative, and measurable impact rather than listing generic responsibilities."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Include all full-time professional experience after completing your undergraduate degree. For most MBA applicants, this means three to eight years of work experience. If you have more than ten years of experience, you may need to be selective, giving more space to recent roles and condensing earlier positions to one or two bullets each. Do not include part-time jobs, summer internships, or work during university unless the experience was exceptional and directly relevant to your MBA narrative."

        "@type": "Question",

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, but be strategic. An additional or interests section at the bottom of your MBA resume gives the admissions committee a glimpse of who you are beyond work. Include activities where you have demonstrated commitment, leadership, or unique depth. Quantify where possible: instead of writing running, write marathon runner with five completed international marathons. Avoid generic entries like reading, cooking, or travel without specifics. This section is often the first thing admissions readers look at because it reveals personality and conversation topics for interviews."

        "name": "What are the biggest mistakes on MBA resumes?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The most common mistakes are: going over one page, listing generic job responsibilities instead of specific achievements, failing to quantify results, using industry jargon that admissions readers may not understand, including an objective statement or personal summary, poor formatting with insufficient white space, starting bullet points with nouns instead of action verbs, and not showing career progression. Another frequent error is treating the MBA resume the same as a job resume, without tailoring it for what admissions committees are looking for."

      {
        "@type": "Question",

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Keep the format clean and professional. Use a standard font like Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman at 10 to 11 point size. Use 0.5 to 1 inch margins. Avoid graphics, images, colours, creative layouts, or multiple columns. Some schools provide their own resume template (such as Harvard Business School), and if they do, use it. If no template is provided, a clean, single-column format with clear section headers is ideal. The content matters far more than the design."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Every field has quantifiable outcomes. If you work in a creative role, think about audience reach, project budgets, team sizes, timelines met, or awards won. In non-profit work, consider funds raised, volunteers managed, beneficiaries served, or programmes launched. In education, think about class sizes, pass rates, curriculum changes adopted, or grants secured. In healthcare, consider patients served, process improvements, or research publications. The key is to translate your impact into numbers that any reader can understand, regardless of their familiarity with your industry."
        }

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Should I include a career objective on my MBA resume?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No. An objective statement or summary takes up valuable space and adds nothing that your essays and application do not already cover. Admissions committees know you are applying to their MBA programme. Use that space for achievements and experiences instead."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes. Harvard Business School provides a specific resume template that applicants are expected to use. It follows a structured format with prescribed sections. If any school provides a template or specific formatting instructions, always follow them exactly. Other schools like Wharton, Stanford, INSEAD, and LBS do not mandate a specific template but expect a clean, professional, one-page format."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Your MBA resume and LinkedIn profile can differ in format and level of detail, but the core facts (dates, titles, companies) must be consistent. Admissions committees do check LinkedIn profiles. Discrepancies in employment dates or job titles will raise red flags. Your MBA resume should be a more focused, curated version of your career story, while LinkedIn can include more detail and context."

This guide tears it apart section by section and shows you exactly what admissions committees are looking for, what wastes their time, and how to prove your impact in every bullet point.</p>

        <div class="blog-post-content">
          
          <p>The MBA resume is one of the most misunderstood documents in the application process. Candidates spend weeks on their essays and interview prep but treat the resume as an afterthought, copying the same document they use for job applications and hoping it will work.</p>
          
          <p>It will not.</p>
          
          <p>An MBA resume serves a fundamentally different purpose from a job resume. A job resume is designed to show an employer that you can do a specific role. An MBA resume is designed to show an admissions committee that you will be a valuable classmate, a future leader, and someone who has already made a measurable impact in your career. The audience is different. The goal is different. The content should be different too.</p>
          
          <p>This guide tears apart the MBA resume section by section. For every element, we cover what to cut, what to keep, and what to prove. By the end, you will know exactly how to build a one-page document that makes an admissions reader want to learn more about you.</p>
          
          <h2>Why the MBA Resume Is Not Your Job Resume</h2>
          
          <p>Before we get into the details, it is worth understanding what admissions committees are actually evaluating when they read your resume. They are not checking whether you can perform a specific job. They are looking for signals of three things:</p>
          
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>What Admissions Committees Evaluate on Your Resume</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Have you made a tangible difference in the organisations and teams you have been part of? Can you point to specific results?</li>
              <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Have you led people, projects, or initiatives? Do you take ownership and drive outcomes?</li>
              <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Has your career progressed? Have your responsibilities increased? Do you show a clear upward trajectory?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <p>Your resume is typically the first document an admissions officer reads. It sets the baseline impression before they move to your essays, recommendations, and interview. According to admissions officers at top programmes, they may spend only 30 to 60 seconds on your resume during the initial review. That means every line must earn its place.</p>
          
          <div class="stat-highlight">
            <span class="stat-highlight-number">60s</span>
            <span class="stat-highlight-text">is the approximate time an admissions officer may spend on your resume during initial review. A focused, one-page resume ensures they see your strongest achievements, not filler.</span>
          </div>
          
          <h2>The One-Page Rule (and Why It Is Non-Negotiable)</h2>
          
          <p>Your MBA resume should be one page. This is not a suggestion. It is an expectation at virtually every top MBA programme, from Harvard and Wharton to INSEAD and LBS.</p>
          
          <div class="myth-box">
            <p>"I have eight years of experience. There is no way I can fit everything on one page."</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="reality-box">
            <p>You are not supposed to fit everything. The one-page constraint is itself a test of your ability to prioritise, synthesise, and communicate what matters most. Admissions committees know this. A two-page resume does not signal more experience. It signals that you cannot edit.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>Think of the one-page limit as a feature, not a constraint. It forces you to be selective. It forces you to cut the filler and keep only the achievements that demonstrate impact, leadership, and growth. A concise resume is a confident resume.</p>
          
          <h3>Formatting Basics That Support the One-Page Rule</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Font:</strong> Use a clean, professional font such as Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman at 10 to 11 point size.</li>
            <li><strong>Margins:</strong> 0.5 to 1 inch on all sides. Anything narrower looks cramped. Anything wider wastes space.</li>
            <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Single column, no graphics, no images, no colours. Some schools (notably Harvard Business School) provide a specific resume template. If they do, use it.</li>
            <li><strong>White space:</strong> Leave enough that the page is easy to scan. A wall of text is harder to read, not more impressive.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Section-by-Section Teardown</h2>
          
          <p>Let us work through the MBA resume from top to bottom. For each section, we will cover what to include, what to cut, and what you need to prove.</p>
          
          <h3>1. Contact Information</h3>
          
          <div class="section-teardown">
            <h4>Contact Information</h4>
            <p>This is the simplest section, but candidates still make mistakes here.</p>
            <div class="teardown-grid">
              <div class="teardown-col keep">
                <h5>Keep</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Full name (bold, 14 to 20pt)</li>
                  <li>Email address (professional)</li>
                  <li>Phone number</li>
                  <li>LinkedIn URL (optional)</li>
                  <li>City and country</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="teardown-col cut">
                <h5>Cut</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Full postal address</li>
                  <li>Date of birth</li>
                  <li>Photo or headshot</li>
                  <li>Marital status</li>
                  <li>Nationality (unless relevant)</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="teardown-col prove">
                <h5>Prove</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Professionalism (use a proper email, not a nickname handle)</li>
                  <li>Attention to detail (no typos in contact info)</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>Keep your contact section to two lines at most. Your name should be the most prominent element on the page. Use a professional email address. If your current email is something like cooldude2003@gmail.com, create a new one with your name.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Education</h3>
          
          <div class="section-teardown">
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>Place education near the top of your resume, after contact information. This is different from many job resumes where education appears at the bottom.</p>
            <div class="teardown-grid">
              <div class="teardown-col keep">
                <h5>Keep</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>University name and degree</li>
                  <li>Graduation year</li>
                  <li>GPA (if above 3.5/4.0)</li>
                  <li>Honours, dean's list, scholarships</li>
                  <li>Relevant exchange programmes</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="teardown-col cut">
                <h5>Cut</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>GPA if below 3.5/4.0</li>
                  <li>High school details</li>
                  <li>Routine coursework lists</li>
                  <li>GMAT/GRE score (submitted separately)</li>
                  <li>Irrelevant certifications</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="teardown-col prove">
                <h5>Prove</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Academic capability (GPA, honours)</li>
                  <li>Intellectual curiosity (relevant coursework, exchange)</li>
                  <li>Commitment to learning</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p><strong>On GPA:</strong> Include it if it strengthens your profile. If your overall GPA is low but your major GPA was strong, you can list the major GPA instead. If your grading system is not a 4.0 scale, include a brief parenthetical conversion or percentile. If your GPA is below the threshold, leave it off entirely. The admissions committee will see it on your transcript; you do not need to draw attention to it on your resume.</p>
          
          <p><strong>On test scores:</strong> Your GMAT, GRE, or other test scores are submitted separately in the application. In most cases, there is no need to include them on your resume. The exception is if the school explicitly asks for them in a resume template.</p>
          
          <p><strong>On high school:</strong> Do not include it. Even if you attended a prestigious secondary school, the education section should focus on your undergraduate (and any postgraduate) education. The only possible exception is if you are applying directly from university with very limited work experience and a secondary school achievement is particularly noteworthy.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Work Experience (the Most Critical Section)</h3>
          
          <p>This is where your MBA resume lives or dies. The work experience section is where admissions committees spend the most time, and it is where the biggest mistakes happen.</p>
          
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>The Core Principle for Work Experience</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Every bullet point should answer this question: <strong>"So what?"</strong></li>
              <li>If a bullet describes what you did but not what resulted from it, it is incomplete.</li>
              <li>If anyone else in your role could claim the same bullet, it is too generic.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="section-teardown">
            <h4>Work Experience</h4>
            <p>List experience in reverse chronological order. Include company name, your title, location, and dates for each role.</p>
            <div class="teardown-grid">
              <div class="teardown-col keep">
                <h5>Keep</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Specific, quantified achievements</li>
                  <li>Leadership examples (people, projects, initiatives)</li>
                  <li>Promotions (listed as separate entries)</li>
                  <li>Cross-functional collaboration</li>
                  <li>3 to 5 bullets per role</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="teardown-col cut">
                <h5>Cut</h5>

          <h3>How to Write Bullet Points That Work</h3>
          
          <p>The difference between a weak MBA resume and a strong one usually comes down to the bullet points. Here is a simple framework that works for every industry and every level of experience.</p>
          
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>The PAR Method: Problem, Action, Result</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Problem or context:</strong> What was the situation or challenge?</li>
              <li><strong>Action:</strong> What did you specifically do? Start with a strong action verb.</li>
              <li><strong>Result:</strong> What happened because of your action? Quantify wherever possible.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <p>Not every bullet needs all three elements explicitly, but every bullet should imply them. The action verb should come first. The result should come last. And the result should include a number whenever possible.</p>
          
          <h3>Before and After: Bullet Point Transformations</h3>
          
          <p>To make this concrete, here are examples of weak bullets transformed into strong ones. These cover different industries and roles.</p>
          
          <div class="before-after">
            <h4>Before and After: MBA Resume Bullets</h4>

            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>Notice the pattern in the "after" examples. Each one starts with an action verb, includes specifics about scale or scope, and ends with a measurable result. That is the standard you should aim for with every bullet on your MBA resume.</p>
          
          <h3>Action Verbs That Signal Leadership</h3>
          
          <p>The verb you choose matters. Admissions committees associate certain verbs with leadership, initiative, and impact. Here are verbs to use and verbs to avoid.</p>
          
          <div class="do-dont-grid">
            <div class="do-box">
              <h4>Strong Action Verbs</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Led, Managed, Directed, Spearheaded</li>
                <li>Launched, Founded, Initiated, Pioneered</li>
                <li>Developed, Built, Designed, Created</li>

            </div>
            <div class="dont-box">

            </div>
          </div>
          
          <h3>Showing Promotions and Career Progression</h3>
          
          <p>If you have been promoted within a company, show it. Promotions are one of the strongest signals of career growth, and they deserve to be visible on your resume.</p>
          
          <p>List each title separately with its own date range and bullet points. Do not flatten two or three roles at the same company into a single entry. If you were an Analyst from 2019 to 2021 and then promoted to Senior Analyst from 2021 to 2024, list them as two separate positions under the same company name. This makes the progression immediately visible to the reader.</p>
          
          <p>If your title did not change but your scope grew significantly (more people, bigger projects, broader responsibilities), use your bullet points to show that progression. Describe early achievements in terms of individual contribution and later ones in terms of team leadership or strategic impact.</p>
          
          <h3>How Far Back Should You Go?</h3>
          
          <p>Include all full-time professional experience after your undergraduate degree. For most MBA applicants, this is three to eight years. If you have more than ten years of experience, allocate more space to recent roles and condense earlier positions to one or two bullets each. The admissions committee cares most about what you are doing now and what you have accomplished recently.</p>
          
          <p>Do not include part-time university jobs, summer internships, or high school work unless the experience was truly exceptional and directly relevant to your MBA story. A summer internship at a hedge fund might be relevant for someone with limited post-university experience. A part-time retail job during university is not.</p>
          
          <h3>4. Additional Section: Extracurriculars, Interests, and Community Involvement</h3>
          
          <div class="section-teardown">
            <h4>Additional / Interests Section</h4>
            <p>This section sits at the bottom of your resume, but do not underestimate its importance. Admissions officers have noted that they often look at this section first because it reveals who you are beyond your job title.</p>
            <div class="teardown-grid">
              <div class="teardown-col keep">

          <p>The key here is specificity. Instead of "running," write "marathon runner; completed five international marathons including Tokyo and Berlin." Instead of "volunteering," write "board member, City Youth Foundation; planned annual fundraising gala raising $150K." Instead of "travel," write "travelled to 35 countries across six continents; conversational in Spanish and basic Mandarin."</p>
          
          <p>This section is your chance to show that you are a well-rounded, interesting person who will contribute to the MBA community inside and outside the classroom. It also provides interview material. Admissions interviewers frequently use this section as a conversation opener, so include only things you can discuss with genuine enthusiasm and depth.</p>
          
          <h2>Quantifying Your Impact: A Guide for Every Industry</h2>
          
          <p>One of the most common objections we hear is: "My work is hard to quantify." This is almost never true. Every role, in every industry, produces outcomes that can be expressed in numbers. The challenge is identifying which numbers matter and how to frame them.</p>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>Consulting and Strategy</h4>
            <p>Consulting resumes are common in MBA applicant pools, which means yours needs to stand out from hundreds of similar profiles. Do not list generic consulting duties.</p>

          <p>Knowing what to leave off is just as important as knowing what to include. Here are items that should not appear on your MBA resume.</p>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>Items to Remove</h4>
            <div class="initiative-card-examples">
              <h5>Cut these from your MBA resume</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective statement or personal summary:</strong> Your essays and application already explain why you want an MBA. This wastes prime resume real estate.</li>
                <li><strong>References or "references available upon request":</strong> Recommendations are handled separately. This line adds nothing.</li>
                <li><strong>Photographs:</strong> Not expected or appropriate on MBA resumes for programmes in the US and UK. Some European or Asian programmes may be different, but when in doubt, leave it off.</li>
                <li><strong>Full postal address:</strong> City and country are sufficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry jargon and acronyms:</strong> The admissions reader may not know what "EBITDA normalisation across BU P&amp;Ls" means. Translate technical language into plain English that any educated professional can understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Every certification and course you have ever completed:</strong> Include only those that are directly relevant to your MBA candidacy or that demonstrate a significant achievement (CFA, CPA, professional licence). Generic online course completions do not belong here.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics, charts, logos, or creative formatting:</strong> MBA resumes should be text-based, clean, and professional. Save the creativity for design portfolios.</li>

          <h2>School-Specific Notes</h2>
          
          <p>While the principles above apply universally, some programmes have specific requirements worth knowing about.</p>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>Harvard Business School (HBS)</h4>
            <p>HBS provides its own resume template that applicants should use. The format is structured with specific sections for education, work experience, and additional information. Follow the template exactly. The content advice in this guide still applies: quantify achievements, use action verbs, and focus on impact and leadership within the HBS format.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>Wharton (University of Pennsylvania)</h4>
            <p>Wharton does not provide a mandatory template but expects a professional, one-page format. Given the analytical culture at Wharton, quantified results are especially important. Make sure your numbers are specific and credible.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>Stanford GSB</h4>
            <p>Stanford's application includes a resume upload. Given Stanford's emphasis on personal impact and "what matters most to you," your resume should reflect achievements that align with purpose and meaningful contribution, not just financial or operational metrics. Show depth and intention.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>INSEAD</h4>
            <p>INSEAD values international experience and diverse perspectives. If you have worked across borders, managed multicultural teams, or contributed to international projects, make sure these appear prominently on your resume. INSEAD's 10-month programme attracts experienced professionals, so the competition for resume impact is high.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>London Business School (LBS)</h4>
            <p>LBS appreciates international and entrepreneurial profiles. Similar to INSEAD, make cross-border experience visible. LBS also values career progression, so show promotions and increasing responsibility clearly.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="initiative-card">
            <h4>Kellogg (Northwestern University)</h4>
            <p>Kellogg's collaborative culture means they value teamwork alongside individual achievement. Include examples of cross-functional work, team leadership, and collaborative outcomes alongside your individual accomplishments.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Common Mistakes That Cost Candidates</h2>
          
          <p>Having reviewed hundreds of MBA resumes, we see the same errors repeatedly. Here are the most damaging ones.</p>
          
          <h3>1. Treating it as a job resume</h3>
          <p>The most fundamental mistake. Job resumes are written to match a job description. MBA resumes are written to demonstrate potential. If you submit the same resume you use for LinkedIn job applications, you are missing the point. Rewrite it from the ground up with the admissions committee as your audience.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Listing duties instead of achievements</h3>
          <p>"Managed quarterly financial reports" tells the reader nothing about your impact. "Managed quarterly financial reporting for a $50M business unit; identified $1.2M in cost savings through variance analysis" tells them exactly what you contributed. Every bullet should answer: what did I do, how well did I do it, and what was the result?</p>
          
          <h3>3. Using jargon your reader will not understand</h3>
          <p>Admissions committees include people from diverse professional backgrounds. A resume full of industry-specific acronyms and technical terminology will confuse, not impress. Translate your work into language that any educated reader can follow. If you are unsure, ask someone outside your industry to read your resume. If they cannot understand a bullet, rewrite it.</p>
          
          <h3>4. Underselling promotions</h3>
          <p>If you were promoted, make it visible. Do not bury two titles in a single entry. List each role separately with its own bullets. Promotions are one of the clearest signals of career growth, and hiding them is a missed opportunity.</p>
          
          <h3>5. Neglecting the additional section</h3>
          <p>A blank or generic interests section is a wasted opportunity. This section humanises you. It gives the interviewer conversation material. It shows that you are more than your job title. Invest time in making it specific, quantified, and genuinely reflective of who you are.</p>
          
          <h3>6. Failing to get outside feedback</h3>
          <p>You are too close to your own career to see it objectively. Have someone else, ideally someone unfamiliar with your industry, read your resume and tell you what they understand and what confuses them. A fresh perspective will reveal jargon, assumptions, and gaps you cannot see yourself.</p>
          
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          
          <h3>How long should an MBA resume be?</h3>
          <p>One page. This applies to nearly all MBA applicants, regardless of experience level. Admissions committees review thousands of resumes and may spend only 30 to 60 seconds on yours. A concise, focused one-page resume demonstrates your ability to prioritise and communicate efficiently.</p>
          
          <h3>How is an MBA resume different from a job resume?</h3>
          <p>An MBA resume is a marketing document for admissions committees, not a job application. Job resumes focus on matching specific job descriptions. MBA resumes should communicate your leadership, impact, growth trajectory, and what you would contribute to the classroom. Admissions committees care about your potential as a leader and classmate, not whether you can perform a specific role.</p>
          
          <h3>Should I include my GPA?</h3>
          <p>Include it if it is above 3.5 on a 4.0 scale (or the equivalent in your system). If it is below this threshold, leave it off. The admissions committee will see your GPA on your transcript. If your GPA is low but you have strong academic indicators elsewhere (high GMAT or GRE, honours, relevant coursework), highlight those instead.</p>
          
          <h3>Should I include my GMAT or GRE score?</h3>
          <p>Generally no. Test scores are submitted separately in the application. Including them on the resume is unnecessary unless the school specifically requests it in a resume template.</p>
          
          <h3>Should I include a career objective?</h3>
          <p>No. Objective statements and personal summaries take up valuable space and add nothing that your essays do not already cover. Use that space for achievements instead.</p>
          
          <h3>How do I quantify achievements in a non-quantitative field?</h3>
          <p>Every field has quantifiable outcomes. In creative roles, think about audience reach, project budgets, team sizes, or awards. In non-profit work, consider funds raised, beneficiaries served, or programmes launched. In education, think about class sizes, pass rates, or curriculum changes adopted. The key is translating your impact into numbers any reader can understand.</p>
          
          <h3>Should I include hobbies and interests?</h3>
          <p>Yes. An additional section at the bottom gives admissions committees a glimpse of who you are beyond work. Include activities with demonstrated commitment and depth. Quantify where possible. Avoid generic entries like "reading" or "travel" without specifics.</p>
          
          <h3>What if I have been at the same company for my entire career?</h3>
          <p>Show progression within the company by listing each role or level change as a separate entry with its own bullet points. Emphasise how your responsibilities, team size, and impact have grown over time. A long tenure at one company is not a weakness if you can demonstrate clear advancement and increasing scope.</p>
          
          <h3>Should I include volunteer work?</h3>
          <p>Yes, if it demonstrates leadership, initiative, or sustained commitment. Place meaningful volunteer experience either in your work experience section (if it was a significant time commitment) or in your additional section. Quantify your impact: funds raised, people served, events organised, hours contributed.</p>
          
          <h3>Can my MBA resume differ from my LinkedIn profile?</h3>
          <p>The format and level of detail can differ, but the core facts (dates, titles, companies) must be consistent. Admissions committees check LinkedIn profiles. Discrepancies in employment dates or job titles will raise red flags. Your MBA resume should be a more focused, curated version of your career story.</p>
          
          <h3>Does Harvard Business School have its own resume template?</h3>
          <p>Yes. HBS provides a specific resume template that applicants should use. If any school provides a template or formatting instructions, follow them exactly. Schools like Wharton, Stanford, INSEAD, and LBS do not mandate a specific template but expect a clean, professional, one-page format.</p>
          
          <h3>How should I handle a career change on my resume?</h3>
          <p>If you have changed industries or functions, your resume should present a coherent narrative of growth and intentional transitions. Use bullet points that highlight transferable skills (leadership, analytical thinking, stakeholder management) rather than industry-specific technical skills. Your essays can explain the reasoning behind the change; your resume should show the results you delivered in each role regardless of the industry.</p>
          
          <h3>What font and formatting should I use?</h3>
          <p>Use a clean font such as Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman at 10 to 11 point size. Margins of 0.5 to 1 inch. Single column layout. No graphics, images, or colours. Consistent date formatting throughout. Enough white space that the page is easy to scan.</p>
          
          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          
          <p>Your MBA resume is a one-page argument for your candidacy. Every line should demonstrate impact, leadership, or growth. If a bullet point does not do at least one of those things, cut it.</p>
          
          <p>Start with the admissions committee in mind. They are not your next employer. They are deciding whether you will be a valuable classmate, a future leader, and someone who will make the most of the MBA experience. Write your resume accordingly.</p>
          
          <p>The strongest MBA resumes are not the ones with the most impressive job titles. They are the ones where every single line proves something specific about the candidate. Be concrete. Be quantified. Be clear. And be one page.</p>
          
          <div class="stat-highlight">
            <span class="stat-highlight-number">1</span>
            <span class="stat-highlight-text">page. That is all you get. Make every line count by proving impact, showing leadership, and demonstrating the career growth that makes you ready for a top MBA programme.</span>
